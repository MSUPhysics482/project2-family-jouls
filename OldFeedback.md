## HW8; Score: 8/20

Fellas, I think that the idea of your project is fine, but I really don't have enough detail to judge whether the scope is right or if you are proposing something that is too narrow or too expansive. I just want to reiterate that you can select just one aspect to work on as long as it's rich enough to explore in a few different ways, but it's also ok to look a few aspects, but not in a ton of depth for each. So, for next week, I'm hoping to see quite a bit more detail in your plans.
