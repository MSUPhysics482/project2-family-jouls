Fellas, what you appear to be solving is a PDE that is relatively easily defined. You will need to explain in more detail where it comes from and how it is derived. It's good to see that you are both sharing the workload as well. What I'm concerned about is how you intend to solve the PDE. For the cylndrical geometry, you can probably think about how to solve it analytically (in the limit of an infinitely long bar). It is also ok to solve the problem numerically. My concern about solving a prism problem is that for most numerical routines corners and sharp edges are hard to model. I would be ok with you solving this cylindrical problem analytically and numerically for your poster and then maybe taking about issues with solving it in other gemotries. So it's up to you, but think about what you have time for.

Fellas, I think I have a much better picture of what you intend to do and I fully support the work. I think that one piece of feedback I would give is that maybe to try to reproduce the work from cylindrical geomtries and then extend it to a single different geometry. That has the advatange of being able to show what you have done works and then you are just trying to change the boundary conditions. Also, I might think about a specific aspect to model rather than trying to do modeling in general, so as you develop your work for next week, think about those specific aspects to narrow your focus to a particular model or set of models. Great work!

Fellas, I think that the idea of your project is fine, but I really don't have enough detail to judge whether the scope is right or if you are proposing something that is too narrow or too expansive. I just want to reiterate that you can select just one aspect to work on as long as it's rich enough to explore in a few different ways, but it's also ok to look a few aspects, but not in a ton of depth for each. So, for next week, I'm hoping to see quite a bit more detail in your plans.
