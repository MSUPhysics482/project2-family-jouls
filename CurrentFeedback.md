Fellas, I'm glad to see that you are getting the output you expected. I'm hoping to see a little more about the model this week and how it relates. I think that you are making progress, but it might be a big push at the end here to get the PDE modeled. It's a great idea to use a built-in solver if you can make it work for you. I know that scipy has some really good ODE solvers, but I haven't tried using it to solve PDEs, so you might have some work cut out for you in getting the software to do what you want. A quick google search lead me to this: http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/Group/readings/pythonissue_3of4.pdf, which might be useful for you. In fact, that issue of CiSE might be interesting to you. Good luck!
