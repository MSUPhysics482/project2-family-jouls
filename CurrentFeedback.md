Fellas, what you appear to be solving is a PDE that is relatively easily defined. You will need to explain in more detail where it comes from and how it is derived. It's good to see that you are both sharing the workload as well. What I'm concerned about is how you intend to solve the PDE. For the cylndrical geometry, you can probably think about how to solve it analytically (in the limit of an infinitely long bar). It is also ok to solve the problem numerically. My concern about solving a prism problem is that for most numerical routines corners and sharp edges are hard to model. I would be ok with you solving this cylindrical problem analytically and numerically for your poster and then maybe taking about issues with solving it in other gemotries. So it's up to you, but think about what you have time for.
