## HW12; Score: 16/20

Sean and Brad, last time I mentioned that the calculations that you are trying to do are probably kind of tough. I think earlier (check the feedback for HW 10) I mentioned that you might try to solve the PDE in solve limit that is a bit easier. I know you are struggling a bit with the code, but is it in solving the PDE or graphically representing it? I do appreciate the "wireframe" of your poster, I don't prefer one to the other, so you can choose what makes sense to you and what you will feel comfortable presenting. So, for the next couple of weeks, I think you can probably fill out a lot of this poster, but you are going to really need to dig into solving this PDE.
